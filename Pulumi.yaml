# This project deploys specialized AI agents on AWS, Hetzner Cloud, or local Docker.
# Agent count and roles are defined in clawup.yaml.
# Identities are discovered from local directories or Git repos.
#
# Cloud agents share a single VPC/network for cost optimization.
# Secrets are managed via Pulumi config (encrypted).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - AWS credentials (for AWS) or Hetzner API token (for Hetzner) or Docker (for local)
#   - Pulumi CLI + account
#   - Tailscale account with HTTPS enabled (cloud deployments)
#
# Deploy via CLI:
#   clawup deploy
#
# Access agents via Tailscale URLs in stack outputs.
