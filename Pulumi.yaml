# This project deploys specialized AI agents on AWS, Hetzner Cloud, or local Docker.
# Agent count and roles are defined in clawup.yaml.
#
# Built-in identities:
#   - Juno (PM): Break down tickets, research, plan and sequence work, track progress, unblock teams
#   - Titus (Eng): Lead engineering, coding, feature development
#   - Scout (Tester): Quality assurance, verification, bug hunting
#
# Cloud agents share a single VPC/network for cost optimization.
# Secrets are managed via Pulumi config (encrypted).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - AWS credentials (for AWS) or Hetzner API token (for Hetzner) or Docker (for local)
#   - Pulumi CLI + account
#   - Tailscale account with HTTPS enabled (cloud deployments)
#
# Deploy via CLI:
