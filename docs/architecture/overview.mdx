# Architecture Overview

Agent Army uses [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) to provision cloud infrastructure as code, with a component-based architecture that supports multiple cloud providers.

## High-Level Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  CLI / Web  │────▶│ Pulumi Stack │────▶│ Cloud Provider  │
│  (Adapter)  │     │ (TypeScript) │     │ (AWS / Hetzner) │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
       │                    │                      │
       ▼                    ▼                      ▼
  agent-army.json    Component Resources    Servers + Volumes
  (Manifest)         (per agent)            + Networking
```

## Key Concepts

### Manifest-Driven
Everything starts with `agent-army.json` — the manifest file that defines your stack, provider, agents, and configuration. The CLI wizard generates this; Pulumi reads it.

### Component Resources
Each agent is provisioned as a Pulumi component resource (`OpenClawAgent` for AWS, `HetznerAgent` for Hetzner). Components encapsulate: server, volume, security group, and cloud-init bootstrap.

### Adapter Pattern
Core logic is separated from runtime concerns through adapters:
- **CLIAdapter** — Interactive terminal prompts via `@clack/prompts`
- **APIAdapter** — HTTP request/response for the web UI

This means the same wizard logic works in both CLI and web contexts.

### Secure Networking
All agents join a Tailscale mesh VPN during bootstrap. SSH access goes through Tailscale — no public ports exposed. Agent hostnames follow the pattern `<stack>-<agent-name>`.
