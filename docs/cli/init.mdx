title: "init"
description: "Interactive setup wizard for configuring your agent team"
---

Interactive setup wizard that walks you through configuring your cloud provider, instance type, owner info, and agent team. Writes `clawup.yaml` and `.env.example` — no secrets are prompted during init.

## Usage

```bash
clawup init [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | Skip overwrite confirmation if `clawup.yaml` already exists |

## Wizard Steps

### 1. Stack Name
Choose a unique name for your deployment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `staging`). This becomes part of your Tailscale hostnames and resource tags.

### 2. Cloud Provider
Select your cloud provider:
- **AWS** — Amazon Web Services EC2 instances
- **Hetzner** — Hetzner Cloud servers (EU/US)

### 3. Region
Choose a deployment region. Options are provider-specific:

**AWS:** us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1

**Hetzner:** fsn1 (Falkenstein), nbg1 (Nuremberg), hel1 (Helsinki), ash (Ashburn)

### 4. Instance Type
Select server size. Affects performance and cost.

### 5. Owner Configuration
- **Name** — Your name (used in agent onboarding)
- **Timezone** — e.g., `America/New_York`
- **Working hours** — e.g., `9am-6pm`

### 6. Agent Selection
Pick from built-in identities, point to a Git repo or local directory, or mix both.

### 7. Review & Confirm
Review your full configuration with cost estimates before saving.

## Examples

```bash
# Standard interactive init
clawup init

# Init, skip overwrite confirmation
clawup init -y
```

## Output

Creates in your current directory:
- `clawup.yaml` — deployment manifest with `${env:VAR}` secret references
- `.env.example` — all required env var names with empty values

The `.clawup/` directory and `.env` are added to `.gitignore` automatically.

## Next Steps

After `init` completes:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secrets
2. Run [`clawup setup`](/cli/setup) to validate secrets and configure Pulumi
3. Run [`clawup deploy`](/cli/deploy) to deploy your agents

See [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment) for full details on the `${env:VAR}` reference system.
