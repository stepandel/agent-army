The Clawup CLI is the primary interface for managing your agent team: setup, deployment, monitoring, access, and teardown.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g clawup
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`init`](/cli/init) | Generate clawup.yaml scaffold (or refresh existing config from identity changes) |
| [`setup`](/cli/setup) | Validate secrets from `.env` and configure Pulumi |
| [`deploy`](/cli/deploy) | Deploy agents with Pulumi |
| [`redeploy`](/cli/redeploy) | Update agents in-place (`pulumi up --refresh`) |
| [`status`](/cli/status) | Show agent statuses from stack outputs |
| [`ssh`](/cli/ssh) | SSH to an agent by name or alias |
| [`validate`](/cli/validate) | Health check agents via Tailscale SSH |
| [`push`](/cli/push) | Push workspace files, skills, and config to running agents |
| [`destroy`](/cli/destroy) | Tear down all resources |
| [`list`](/cli/list) | Show project config |

## Local Docker Mode

Most commands that operate on deployments support `--local` to target local Docker containers instead of cloud infrastructure:

```bash
clawup deploy --local       # Deploy locally
clawup redeploy --local     # Redeploy local containers
clawup status --local       # Check local container status
clawup ssh titus --local    # Shell into local container
clawup validate --local     # Health check local containers
clawup push --local         # Push files to local containers
clawup destroy --local      # Tear down local containers
```

## Global Options

```bash
clawup --version    # Show version
clawup --help       # Show help
clawup <cmd> --help # Show command-specific help
```

## Project-Based Config

Every deployment lives in a project directory with `clawup.yaml` at its root. Run commands from within your project directory and the CLI auto-detects the config.
