# Destroy with confirmation
clawup destroy

# Skip confirmation (use with caution)
clawup destroy --yes

# Destroy local Docker containers only
clawup destroy --local

<Warning>
This permanently deletes all servers, volumes, and associated data. This action cannot be undone. Make sure to back up any important data before destroying.
