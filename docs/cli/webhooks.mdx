Sets up Linear webhooks so that ticket state changes are routed to the appropriate agents automatically.

## Usage

```bash
clawup webhooks setup
```

## What It Does

1. Reads your `clawup.yaml` manifest and identifies agents with the `openclaw-linear` plugin
2. Creates Linear webhooks pointing to each agent's OpenClaw gateway endpoint
3. Configures webhook secrets for secure payload verification

<Note>
Agents must be deployed and accessible via Tailscale before setting up webhooks.
