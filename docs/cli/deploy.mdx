description: "Deploy your agent team with Pulumi"
---

Provisions infrastructure and deploys your agent team using Pulumi.

## Usage

```bash
clawup deploy [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `-l, --local` | Deploy to local Docker containers instead of cloud |

## What It Does

1. Reads your `clawup.yaml` manifest from the project root
2. Runs `pulumi up` to provision/update infrastructure
3. Creates servers, volumes, networking, and security groups
4. Bootstraps each agent with OpenClaw and configured tools
5. Connects agents to your Tailscale network

## Local Docker Mode

Use `--local` to run agents in local Docker containers for testing:

```bash
clawup deploy --local
```

This creates a separate Pulumi stack (`<stackName>-local`), copies config from your cloud stack (skipping Tailscale keys), and runs agents locally. No cloud resources are created.

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy with confirmation
clawup deploy

# Deploy without confirmation
clawup deploy --yes

# Deploy to local Docker containers
clawup deploy --local --yes
```

<Note>
First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are incremental — only changes are applied.
</Note>

<Warning>
Deployment creates cloud resources that incur costs. Review your config and cost estimates before deploying.
</Warning>
