title: "What is Clawup?"
description: "Deploy a fleet of autonomous AI agents on your own cloud infrastructure"
---

Clawup deploys autonomous [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agents on your own cloud infrastructure — AWS or Hetzner. Each agent is defined by a composable **identity** that packages personality, skills, model preferences, and tool configuration into a self-contained, reusable unit. Agents run 24/7 on dedicated servers, coordinating through integrations like Linear, GitHub, and Slack.

## Why Clawup?

You define _what_ your agents do through identities. Clawup handles _where_ and _how_ they run — provisioning servers, installing tools, configuring networking, and keeping agents operational.

Each agent has a specific role, persistent memory, and the tools to do its job. Create identities for any role you need — PM, engineer, QA, researcher, or anything else.

## How It Works

1. **Configure** — Run `clawup init` to discover local identities, set up your cloud provider, and connect integrations
2. **Deploy** — Run `clawup deploy` to provision your agents on dedicated servers
3. **Assign work** — Move tickets through your Linear workflow and agents pick them up automatically. The [Linear plugin](/integrations/linear#linear-plugin) watches for ticket state changes and routes them into per-agent queues — each agent's [queue handler](/architecture/identities#how-agents-coordinate) processes tickets end-to-end
4. **Monitor** — Use `clawup status`, `ssh`, and `validate` to check on your agents
